## Overview

R Shiny is a powerful framework for building interactive web applications using R. This project leverages Shiny to create user-friendly interfaces for ML tools, making it easier for users to apply ML techniques.

## Features

- **Data Summary** : Tools for data summary
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Tools for plotting and exploring datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and preparing data for ML tasks.
- **Model Training**: Interfaces for training ML models using various algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Tools for evaluating model performance.
- **Prediction**: Interfaces for making predictions using trained models.


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- R (version 3.5 or later)
- RStudio (recommended) or shiny server
- Shiny library

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/himakund/ML_Demo.git
   cd ML_Demo
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "caret", "randomForest"))
   ```

3. Run the Shiny app:
   ```R
   library(shiny)
   runApp("app")
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the App**:
   Open RStudio, navigate to the cloned repository, and run the `app.R` script.

2. **Explore the Interface**:
   Use the sidebar to navigate between different tools and functionalities.

3. **Load Data**:
   Upload your dataset using the data upload tool. Supported formats include CSV and Excel. You can also use provided sample data

4. **Visualize Data**:
   Use the data visualization tools to create plots and explore your data.

5. **Train Models(WIP)**:
   Select the model training tool, choose an algorithm, and configure the parameters to train your model.

6. **Evaluate Models(WIP)**:
   Use the evaluation tool to assess model performance using various metrics.

7. **Make Predictions(WIP)**:
   Input new data into the prediction tool to make predictions using your trained model.
